# Custom-32-Bit-RISC-Processor-Core-Designed-in-Verilog
This project involves the design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC processor using Verilog HDL. The processor supports basic arithmetic, logical, memory, and branch operations, including add, sub, and, or, slt, lw, sw, and beq. Key modules such as the Program Counter, ALU, Control Unit, Register File, and Instruction Memory are developed from scratch. The processor follows a simplified RISC architecture and simulates instruction execution cycle-by-cycle. Functional testing is performed using a Verilog testbench with waveform analysis through .vcd traces.
